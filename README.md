# üìô Main information
This modpack was created for people who need a bit of QoL-mods with better optimization and OF parity. As OptiFine, but much better and faster.
# ‚ùì What about FPS?
In the near future, I will try to make a comparison between Nickly Optimized, Fabulously Optimized and Additive, but so far I can only say that the modpack is really good in terms of responses.
# ü§î Why Nickly Optimized?
Your choice is yours, and I don't want to force you to use my modpack, but I'll appreciate your support and downloads. This modpack has good optimization pack, which gives the best results on every server/singleworld.
